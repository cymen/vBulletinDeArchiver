vBulletin DeArchiver (Google Chrome Extension)
==============================================

When searching on Google, it is not uncommon to find results from vBulletin forums that go to the archive view of the content instead of going directly to the regular vBulletin display. This plugin detects when you land on an vBulletin archive page and automatically redirects you to the regular view of the content (while still allowing you to use the back button on your browser).
